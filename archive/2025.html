                                <p> I will give a high-level overview of graph representation
                                    learning that uses homomorphism counting in one way or the
                                    other. Homomorphism counting is a way to measure 'how often' a
                                    given pattern appears in a graph. In the context of (message
                                    passing) graph neural networks (GNNs), homomorphism counting is
                                    mainly used in two areas: (1) Quantifying what GNNs can do and
                                    where they fail and (2) improving the capabilities of GNNs.
                                    Special interest in both these areas lies on the expressivity of
                                    GNNs, i.e., their ability to learn different representations for
                                    nonisomorphic graphs. I will present and discuss the basics, as
                                    well as recent results in this interesting and active area of
                                    research.</p>

                                <p> Electricity markets and their associated operational structures play a pivotal role
                                    in ensuring a secure, reliable, and economically efficient energy supply. By
                                    facilitating competition among diverse power producers - from conventional
                                    fossil-fuel generators to renewable energy sources - electricity markets promote
                                    transparency in pricing and stimulate innovation. Key market mechanisms, such as
                                    day-ahead auctions and intraday trading, help align generation with demand,
                                    encouraging optimal resource allocation and minimizing imbalances in real time.On an
                                    operational level, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) oversee grid reliability
                                    through balancing markets and ancillary services, ensuring electricity flows
                                    reliably across interconnected networks. These operators deploy mechanisms like
                                    reserve capacity activation and frequency control to stabilize the system whenever
                                    unexpected deviations in supply or demand occur. Furthermore, the integration of
                                    distributed energy resources and the rise of prosumers introduce new complexity and
                                    opportunities, including peer-to-peer trading and localized market initiatives.
                                    Overall, the interplay between electricity market design and operational frameworks
                                    underpins the modern power sector’s resilience, adaptability, and efficiency. By
                                    continuously refining these market structures and coordinating operations across
                                    borders and jurisdictions, stakeholders can foster a robust and sustainable energy
                                    ecosystem that meets evolving societal needs.</p>
