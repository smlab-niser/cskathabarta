                            <span class="weak"> Deep Learning models have now become ubiquitous. However, the hardware
                                requirements to deploy SoTA models are increasing at a faster rate than what Moore's law
                                can deliver. This makes such models challenging to deploy. Model compression,
                                particularly pruning, is one way to alleviate this problem. Modern, multi-branched
                                neural network architectures often possess complex interconnections like residual
                                connections between layers, which we call coupled channels (CCs). Most existing works
                                are typically designed for pruning single-branch models like VGG-nets. While these
                                methods yield accurate subnetworks, the improvements in inference times, when applied to
                                multi-branch networks, are comparatively modest. These methods do not prune CCs, which
                                we observe contribute significantly to inference time. Moreover, pruning without access
                                to training data is challenging and is gaining traction owing to privacy concerns and
                                computational costs associated with fine-tuning. In this talk, we will see some recent
                                advances towards pruning neural networks without access to training data.</span>

                                This talk explores multi-agent RAG’s architecture, benefits over single-agent
                                models, and key challenges, including agent coordination and retrieval bias. We
                                discuss optimization strategies, reinforcement learning for self-improvement, and
                                future research directions. Multi-agent RAG represents the next step in intelligent,

                                imaging. However,
                                in this mission-critical domain, the evaluation of generative models is imperative
                                to ensure patient safety. Designing evaluation frameworks for generative models is
                                essential at different stages in the biomedical-tool development process. In this
                                talk, I will focus on generative models of images for data augmentation
                                applications. I will discuss the limitations of some existing approaches and present

                                learning that uses homomorphism counting in one way or the
                                other. Homomorphism counting is a way to measure 'how often' a
                                given pattern appears in a graph. In the context of (message
                                passing) graph neural networks (GNNs), homomorphism counting is
                                mainly used in two areas: (1) Quantifying what GNNs can do and
                                where they fail and (2) improving the capabilities of GNNs.
                                Special interest in both these areas lies on the expressivity of
                                GNNs, i.e., their ability to learn different representations for
                                nonisomorphic graphs. I will present and discuss the basics, as
                                well as recent results in this interesting and active area of

                            <span class="weak"> Instance-level explanation of graph neural networks (GNNs) is a
                                well-studied area.
                                These explainers, however, only explain an instance (e.g., a graph) and fail to
                                uncover the combinatorial reasoning learned by a GNN from the training data towards
                                making its predictions. In this work, we introduce GraphTrail, the first end-to-end,
                                global, post-hoc GNN explainer that translates the functioning of a black-box GNN
                                model to a boolean formula over the (sub)graph level concepts without relying on
                                local explainers. GraphTrail is unique in automatically mining the discriminative
                                subgraph-level concepts using Shapley values. Subsequently, the GNN predictions are
                                mapped to a human-interpretable boolean formula over these concepts through symbolic
                                regression. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and GNN architectures
                                demonstrate significant improvement over existing global explainers in mapping GNN
                                predictions to faithful logical formulae. The robust and accurate performance of
                                GraphTrail makes it invaluable for improving GNNs and facilitates adoption in
                                domains with strict transparency requirements.

                            <span class="weak"> Electricity markets and their associated operational structures play a
                                pivotal role
                                in ensuring a secure, reliable, and economically efficient energy supply. By
                                facilitating competition among diverse power producers - from conventional
                                fossil-fuel generators to renewable energy sources - electricity markets promote
                                transparency in pricing and stimulate innovation. Key market mechanisms, such as
                                day-ahead auctions and intraday trading, help align generation with demand,
                                encouraging optimal resource allocation and minimizing imbalances in real time.On an
                                operational level, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) oversee grid reliability
                                through balancing markets and ancillary services, ensuring electricity flows
                                reliably across interconnected networks. These operators deploy mechanisms like
                                reserve capacity activation and frequency control to stabilize the system whenever
                                unexpected deviations in supply or demand occur. Furthermore, the integration of
                                distributed energy resources and the rise of prosumers introduce new complexity and
                                opportunities, including peer-to-peer trading and localized market initiatives.
                                Overall, the interplay between electricity market design and operational frameworks
                                underpins the modern power sector’s resilience, adaptability, and efficiency. By
                                continuously refining these market structures and coordinating operations across
                                borders and jurisdictions, stakeholders can foster a robust and sustainable energy
                                ecosystem that meets evolving societal needs.</span>
