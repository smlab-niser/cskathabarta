            <p>Humans (e.g. crowd workers) have the remarkable ability to solve different tasks by simply reading
              textual instructions that define the tasks and looking at a few examples. NLP models built with the
              conventional machine learning paradigm, however, often struggle to generalize across tasks (e.g., a
              question-answering system cannot solve classification tasks) despite training with lots of examples. A
              long-standing challenge in AI is to build a model that learns a new task by understanding the
              human-readable instructions that define it. To study this, we build NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS, a large-scale
              dataset of diverse tasks, their human-authored instructions, and instances. We adopt generative
              pre-trained language models to encode task-specific instructions along with input and generate task
              output. Our results indicate that the instruction encoding helps models achieve cross-task generalization.
              Additionally, the instruction paradigm improves the accessibility of NLP modules to non-expert users by
              enabling fast model design through plain text instructions of a new NLP task. Backed by extensive
              empirical analysis on GPT3, we observe important features for successful instructional prompts and propose
              several reframing techniques for model designers to create such prompts. Our results show that reframing
              notably improves few-shot learning performance; this is particularly important on large language models,
              such as GPT3 where tuning models or prompts on large datasets is not feasible.</p>

            <p>Currently, smell design is an enigma bordering alchemy. In spite of many attempts at understanding how
              smell is brought about, we still don't have an objective way of telling what a molecule will smell like,
              given only its chemical structure. The talk proposes to design algorithms capable of predicting the smell
              of a molecule with the help of data science and machine learning. It has its challenges right from the
              data collection to the understanding of smell itself. I have been working on these lines to design
              algorithms and instruments to predict the smell/taste of a molecule using its physico-chemical and
              structural properties since last 5 years . The most exciting part of being in this research is its direct
              connection with basic science as well as technology. </p>

              improving the technology of perfume making along with the science of perfumery and hence the economy.

            Abstract - Volume visualization is a technique in computer graphics where a 3D scalar field is visualised to
            highlight internal structures of a volume. We will discuss existing volume visualization algorithms and see
            how these can be applied to medical volumes like CT and MRI. Without effective visualization, understanding
            such medical data is difficult. To this end we will discuss newer methods such as a graph based volume
            visualization algorithm developed at our research group. We will also look at applying AI based intelligence
            to transform medical imaging data to more a meaningful representation.

            Abstract - Increasing number of patents and papers attest to the fact that smart materials-based smart
            structures/systems have a high potential of being applied in our day-to-day applications. The current
            scenario shows that the physics, chemistry, and engineering disciplines are the ones who have any exposure
            to the field of smart materials. This exposure has motivated the researchers to study the material to
            develop innovative devices to assist and improve human life. The vast list of smart systems includes
            examples from tiny Nitinol-based self-expandable coronary stents to Piezo-based structural health/condition
            monitoring of huge composite wind turbine blades and many more. However, these deployments are mostly
            limited to small scales. This talk presents an introduction to smart materials and recent innovative
            research in the field of smart materials-based systems (such as structural health monitoring (SHM) of
            composites using piezoceramic transducers and others) to faculty and students of the computer science
            department at NISER. While the physical smart material’s components act as limbs for sensing and actuation
            of the smart structures, computer systems act as the brain for efficient operations of these smart
            structures. However limited understanding, knowledge, and expertise of smart materials among CS have
            throttled the applicability and development of smart structures on a large scale. A harmonious collaboration
            between computer science and engineering researchers can lead to the development of integrated Next-gen
            smart systems for the betterment of humanity all around the globe. This talk will also briefly present other
            successful applications of smart materials for SHM, actuation, and sensing in the field of civil, energy,
            and medical industry, which can be helpful for the development of future smart cities. All these research
            and development activities for the future could fall short if the next generation of engineers and
            researchers do not think out of the box with the knowledge they have.

            Abstract - We address the problem of localizing an (unauthorized) transmitter using a distributed set of
            sensors. Our focus is on developing techniques that perform the transmitter localization in an efficient
            manner, wherein the efficiency is defined in terms of the number of sensors used to localize. Localization
            of unauthorized transmitters is an important problem which arises in many important applications, e.g., in
            patrolling of shared spectrum systems for any unauthorized users. Localization of transmitters is generally
            done based on observations from a deployed set of sensors with limited resources, thus it is imperative to
            design techniques that minimize the sensors’ energy resources. In this paper, we design greedy approximation
            algorithms for the optimization problem of selecting a given number of sensors in order to maximize an
            appropriately defined objective function of localization accuracy. The obvious greedy algorithm delivers a
            constant-factor approximation only for the special case of two hypotheses (potential locations). For the
            general case of multiple hypotheses, we design a greedy algorithm based on an appropriate auxiliary
            objective function—and show that it delivers a provably approximate solution for the general case. We
            develop techniques to significantly reduce the time complexity of the designed algorithms by incorporating
            certain observations and reasonable assumptions. We evaluate our techniques over multiple simulation
            platforms, including an indoor as well as an outdoor testbed, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
            designed techniques—our techniques easily outperform prior and other approaches by up to 50-60% in
            large-scale simulations and up to 16% in small-scale testbeds.
