        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>Conventional robots and machines are made of rigid materials that limit their ability to elastically deform and adapt their shape to external constraints and obstacles. The natural creatures are made of soft materials. Soft robotics is an emerging topic in the field of robotics which challenges traditional engineering thinking. SMA actuators are able to generate large displacements with simple mechanisms. SMAs are available in various geometrical forms such as spring, wire embedded soft composite, and bimorph which can be suitably coupled or employed with soft materials to develop bioinspired robots. The thesis work aims to employ the different forms of SMA structures like spring, wire and bimorph towards the development of soft robots. The feasibility of SMA based structure in the development of bio-inspired soft robots will be demonstrated.</p>
