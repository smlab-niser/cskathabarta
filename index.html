                        <li>Abstract: Web applications constitute a large class of software applications that run on the web. They can simple static websites or complex dynamic applications including web services. Web applications are developed using various technologies, with one single application involving several different languages and frameworks. This makes testing of web applications challenging and interesting. This talk will describe web applications, their features, the challenges involved in testing them and highlight a few research techniques for testing web applications.</li>

                        <li>Title: Multiscale Computational Thinking in Science and Engineering</li>
                        <li>Abstract: In several scientific data applications across several domains, including geoscience, and biomedicine, we encounter the need to use validation from the data itself given the absence of ground truth. Uncertainty in the data that manifests in several analytical operations must also be derived from the data itself, in several cases. In such cases, the use of multiple scales in computational methods is a powerful tool in understanding scientific and engineering data better. The definition of the scale itself changes depending on the application and the data type. Physically, scales are applicable for space and time. However, increasingly, we see scale descriptions used for image processing and other data science workflows. In this talk, we look at various examples where scales are used for a varied set of applications, to show how multiscale methods continue to be relevant.</li>

                        <li>Title: Multimodal AI for Conversations</li>
                        <li>Abstract: In this talk, we will discuss three research threads. We will present the general trends, followed by our contributions. First thread involves technologies for off-line multimodal assessment and feedback in interviewing and presentation settings. While nonverbal and verbal assessment is important from the interviewer's view-point, feedback is important for the candidate. Recent trends in terms of research will be summarized, that includes both modeling and HCI developments. The second research thread concerns technologies for real-time multimodal conversational agents and applications. Multimodal analysis enables understanding user emotion and state, multimodal dialog enables making use of this information along with spoken text and subsequently generate the surface text along with the appropriate state for the virtual agent, and finally the multimodal synthesis module generates suitable nonverbal behavior and prosody for the agent reply. These systems can find applications in healthcare or education, where information can be solicited from the user and a simple task-oriented conversation can be accomplished. Innovations for quickly customizing the avatar appearance and animations are also emerging. The final research thread involves Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based multimodal analysis and synthesis systems to perform controlled conversational research. GANs can generate human centered images and videos, and hence enabling study of appearance and behavior manipulation, which enables controlled conversational experiments.</li>

                        <li>Title: ReTAG - Real Time Anomaly Detection on Blockchain Graph</li>
                        <li>Abstract: For decentralized financial services on enterprise blockchain networks like Liink by Onyx, J.P.Morgan, it is critical to ensure the messages and traffic flowing in the network as safe and anomaly free. This is to maintain a healthy network, intelligent enough to learn anomalies happening on network, in real time and to notify actors appropriately. In the solution deployed in Liink network, the model is intelligent to identify unsupervised anomalies, in real time, on streams of data and blockchain transactions. From engineering design perspective, the model is of constant space and time complexity by design, as it uses probabilistic data structure to store the model weights. Also to note, ReTAG is designed for graph data structure, where model environment can be represented as a graph. With explainable feature of the model, it is planned to be integrated with human powered feedback system, to rectify unsupervised classified labels, and adjust the weights of existing models to accommodate the human feedbacks. ReTAG has potential to identify numerous unseen anomalies, with very low rate of false positivity and can fit in multiple graph representations.</li>

                        <li>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which generalize traditional deep neural networks on graph data, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on several graph analytical tasks. With their growing popularity in various applications including sensitive applications like health it is imperative to study the privacy aspects of these models. In this talk I will discuss the vulnerability of GNNs to privacy leakage and also present our framework on releasing GNNs under differential privacy guarantees.</li>

                        <li>Title: Geometric Deep Learning for Graphs and Point Clouds</li>
                        <li>Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in cutting-edge research on geometric machine learning for complex structured data such as 3D point clouds, graphs, and manifolds. While traditional ML has mainly focused on data in the Euclidean domain, in comparison, geometric ML aims to generalize to non-Euclidean domains. However, working with the non-Euclidean domain is accompanied by its own set of research challenges, namely, varying sizes of vertex neighborhoods, as opposed to images with regular grids and fixed neighborhood sizes. Additionally, there are no standard distance metrics between graphs. In this talk, we will focus on geometric representation learning for 3D point clouds and briefly on graphs.</li>

                        <li>Title: Multi-Tenancy in a SaaS environment</li>
                        <li>Abstract: Tenant isolation is fundamental to the design and development of Software as a Service (SaaS) systems. It enables SaaS providers to reassure customers that—even in a multitenant environment—their resources cannot be accessed by other tenants. This talk will cover architectural patterns that solve tenancy and associated problems such as Noisy Neighbor. We will also deep dive into advanced topics and solutions that AWS implements to achieve Tenant Isolation.</li>
