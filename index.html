                                <p>Accept-reject based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have traditionally
                                    utilised acceptance probabilities that can be explicitly written as a function of
                                    the ratio of the target density at the two contested points. This feature is
                                    rendered almost useless in Bayesian posteriors with unknown functional forms. We
                                    introduce a new family of MCMC acceptance probabilities that has the distinguishing
                                    feature of not being a function of the ratio of the target density at the two
                                    points. We present a stable Bernoulli factory that generates events within this
                                    class of acceptance probabilities. The efficiency of our methods rely on obtaining
                                    reasonable local upper or lower bounds on the target density and we present an
                                    application of MCMC on constrained spaces where this is reasonable. </p>

                        <li>Title: PAC Privacy: Automatic Privacy Measurement and Control of Data Processing</li>
                        <li>
                            <details>

                                <p> We propose and study a new privacy definition, termed Probably Approximately Correct
                                    (PAC) Privacy. PAC Privacy characterizes the information-theoretic hardness to
                                    recover sensitive data given arbitrary information disclosure/leakage during/after
                                    any processing. Unlike the classic cryptographic definition and Differential Privacy
                                    (DP), which consider the adversarial (input-independent) worst case, PAC Privacy is
                                    a simulatable metric that quantifies the instance-based impossibility of inference.
                                    A fully automatic analysis and proof generation framework is proposed: security
                                    parameters can be produced with arbitrarily high confidence via Monte-Carlo
                                    simulation for any black-box data processing oracle. On the utility side, the
                                    magnitude of (necessary) perturbation required in PAC Privacy is not lower bounded
                                    by Θ(√d) for a d-dimensional release but could be O(1) for many practical data
                                    processing tasks, which is in contrast to the input-independent worst-case
                                    information-theoretic lower bound. We discuss applications of PAC Privacy to
                                    statistical data processing tasks. </p>

                                <p>The prototype selection problem aims to learn a sparse distribution of a source set
                                    such that it best matches a different target set. The applications of this problem
                                    include target subset selection, data summarization, and clustering, to name a few.

                                    In this talk, we present efficient algorithms for the prototype selection problem.
                                    Using the optimal transport theory, the proposed optimization formulation is an
                                    instance of submodular maximization, and therefore, we propose a greedy algorithm
                                    with simple updates. We further make use of the bandit setup to reduce the
                                    computations. The presentation is based on the papers [1, 2].

                                <p>In the context of global climate change that threatens human civilization in multiple
                                    ways, climate sciences have become a crucial topic of research. The parallel
                                    progress in the field of Machine Learning and the availability of huge volumes of
                                    climate-related data from multiple sources has sparked off interest in using
                                    data-driven approaches to answer crucial questions in climate science. Such
                                    questions involve short-term weather forecasts, long-term climate simulations and
                                    discovery of new laws and relations. Recent research has shown that it is possible
                                    to use models and algorithms related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning to answer
                                    more such questions successfully than earlier. In this talk, we will discuss several

                                <p> Speech and language technologies have gained widespread acceptance worldwide in
                                    recent years. With new technology users rapidly growing in India, it is an important
                                    challenge to build inclusive technologies that cater to these new users. There are
                                    notable challenges towards achieving this goal largely owing to India's rich
                                    linguistic diversity. Multilinguality among Indian users contributes to large
                                    variations in speech accents that adversely affect speech recognition performance,
                                    even on resource-rich languages like English. User in multilingual societies like
                                    India also make frequent user of code-switching, i.e. mixing multiple languages
                                    while communicating, that further complicates user-machine interactions. In this
                                    talk, we will look at some of our recent work that aims to address these important
                                    challenges and outline a vision for widespread adoption of speech and language
                                    technologies in India.</p>

                                <p>Over the last decade, there has been an explosive increase in AI/ML
                                    applications—all thanks to powerful computational resources like GPUs and TPUs.
                                    Recent trends suggest that computational requirements of AI, ML, and Graphics
                                    applications are briskly outpacing the supply. Innovations are necessary for the
                                    semiconductor industry to keep up the pace. All such applications are data
                                    intensive; hence, conventional technology of moving the data from the memory to the
                                    core limits performance. However, researchers have proven we can fill this gap by
                                    introducing near-memory and in-memory computation. This talk will cover the basics
                                    of such computing resources and opportunities to revive, research, and develop such
                                    systems.</p>

                                <p>
                                    Despite their success, the performance of neural networks has been shown to be
                                    brittle to mismatch between train and test distributions. Previous works have
                                    hypothesized that this brittleness is caused because deep networks rely only on
                                    simple features of the input (such as background or texture of images) to make
                                    decisions, while completely ignoring complex features. Surprisingly, we find that
                                    the features learnt by network’s backbone are sufficient for out of distribution
                                    generalization, however, the final classifier layer trained using ERM does not use
                                    these features optimally for the same. We posit two reasons for this:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>dominance of non-robust features</li>
                                    <li>replication of simple features, leading to over-dependence of the max-margin
                                        classifier on these.</li>
                                </ol>

                                We empirically validate these hypotheses on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets.
                                We also draw connections with the line of work studying simplicity bias of neural
                                nets. We then propose two methods to deal with both of these phenomena, and show
                                gains of upto 1.5% over the state-of-the-art on DomainBed - a standard and
                                large-scale benchmark for domain generalization.

                                <p>The need for explainability of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models and the development
                                    of AI systems that can fundamentally reason has exponentially increased in recent
                                    years, especially with the increasing use of AI/ML models in risk-sensitive and
                                    safety-critical applications. Causal reasoning helps identify input variables that
                                    cause a certain prediction, rather than merely be correlated, and thus provide
                                    useful explanations in practice. Similarly, focusing on causal input-output
                                    relationships can help a DNN model generalize to out-of-distribution samples better,
                                    where spurious correlations in training data may otherwise mislead a model. This
                                    talk will introduce the growing field of explainable AI, summarize existing efforts
                                    and focus on one important aspect of causality in DNN models -- the notion of causal
                                    attributions between input and output variables of the model. We will do this from
                                    two perspectives -- firstly, we will study how one can "deduce" what causal
                                    input-output attributions an already-trained DNN model has learned, and provide an
                                    efficient mechanism to compute such causal attributions (based on our work published
                                    at ICML 2019). Secondly, we will explore the complementary side of this problem on
                                    how one can "induce" known prior causal information into DNN models during the
                                    training process itself (based on our work published at ICML 2022) . Both of these
                                    efforts are derived by a first-principles approach to integrating causal principles
                                    into DNN models, and can have significant implications on practice in real-world
                                    applications. </p>

                                <p>We propose a method of quantum machine learning called quantum mutual information
                                    neural estimation (QMINE) for estimating von Neumann entropy and quantum mutual
                                    information, which are fundamental properties in quantum information theory. The
                                    QMINE proposed here basically utilizes a technique of quantum neural networks
                                    (QNNs), to minimize a loss function that deter- mines the von Neumann entropy, and
                                    thus quantum mutual information, which is believed more powerful to process quantum
                                    datasets than conventional neural networks due to quantum superposi- tion and
                                    entanglement. To create a precise loss function, we propose a quantum
                                    Donsker-Varadhan representation (QDVR), which is a quantum analog of the classical
                                    Donsker-Varadhan represen- tation. By exploiting a parameter shift rule on
                                    parameterized quantum circuits, we can efficiently implement and optimize the QNN
                                    and estimate the quantum entropies using the QMINE technique. Furthermore, numerical
                                    observations support our predictions of QDVR and demonstrate the good performance of
                                    QMINE. </p>

                                <p>Dialogue systems or Conversational AI agents are becoming increasingly popular. These
                                    adoptions are mostly backed by promising potentials and commercial values of such
                                    systems. With the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and related research,
                                    the quality of the generated responses in dialogue systems has been further
                                    enhanced. This is in turn increasing the potential of such systems. However, there
                                    are many scenarios where organizations are hesitant in adopting such dialogue
                                    systems. This is mainly due to the black-box nature of generating the responses. For
                                    any dialogue system to be effective, its responses should be explainable. Without
                                    explainability, the confidence in the generated responses is low. Poor quality
                                    responses with a lack of explanation can hit user satisfaction and can hurt business
                                    and/or relations. In this talk, we will focus on having explainability in dialogue
                                    systems - from the perspectives of both modelling and evaluation. </p>

                                <p>Drawings are a powerful cognitive technology for creating external representations of
                                    thoughts. Can they be used as an alternative or complementary to natural language
                                    for cross-modal tasks? We have investigated this in some of our recent works. This
                                    talk will be around this theme. Specifically, I will talk about sketch+text for
                                    Image Retrieval, sketch-guided object localization, and sketch-guided image
                                    inpainting works. Toward the end, I shall conclude the talk with open topics in this
                                    area. </p>
