                                <p>Over the last decade, there has been an explosive increase in AI/ML
                                    applications—all thanks to powerful computational resources like GPUs and TPUs.
                                    Recent trends suggest that computational requirements of AI, ML, and Graphics
                                    applications are briskly outpacing the supply. Innovations are necessary for the
                                    semiconductor industry to keep up the pace. All such applications are data
                                    intensive; hence, conventional technology of moving the data from the memory to the
                                    core limits performance. However, researchers have proven we can fill this gap by
                                    introducing near-memory and in-memory computation. This talk will cover the basics
                                    of such computing resources and opportunities to revive, research, and develop such
                                    systems.</p>

                                <p>The prototype selection problem aims to learn a sparse distribution of a source set
                                    such that it best matches a different target set. The applications of this problem
                                    include target subset selection, data summarization, and clustering, to name a few.

                                    In this talk, we present efficient algorithms for the prototype selection problem.
                                    Using the optimal transport theory, the proposed optimization formulation is an
                                    instance of submodular maximization, and therefore, we propose a greedy algorithm
                                    with simple updates. We further make use of the bandit setup to reduce the
                                    computations. The presentation is based on the papers [1, 2].

                                <p>In the context of global climate change that threatens human civilization in multiple
                                    ways, climate sciences have become a crucial topic of research. The parallel
                                    progress in the field of Machine Learning and the availability of huge volumes of
                                    climate-related data from multiple sources has sparked off interest in using
                                    data-driven approaches to answer crucial questions in climate science. Such
                                    questions involve short-term weather forecasts, long-term climate simulations and
                                    discovery of new laws and relations. Recent research has shown that it is possible
                                    to use models and algorithms related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning to answer
                                    more such questions successfully than earlier. In this talk, we will discuss several
                                    such applications of Machine Learning and Data Science in the domain of Climate
                                    Sciences.
